# HTML Judge Evaluator Documentation

This directory contains the documentation for the testing library included with the HTML judge.

Note that examples in these files often leave some repetitive information out because it is the same thing every single time. This makes the document more compact, and leaves the focus on the elements that matter the most in the current paragraph. Examples of left-out information include imports and adding `ChecklistItem`s to `TestSuite`s.
